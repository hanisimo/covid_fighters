were elementary and the graphics terrible❗️ This a take on an 8bit game, with simple gameplay and 
terribly old fashioned graphics 😅 

This game uses a simple Flutter code serves as basic "game engine", the engine (core) of the game 
has been developed based on the published repository on https://github.com/amugofjava/dash_run
