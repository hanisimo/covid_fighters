# COVID-19 Fighter (Coronavirus 8bit Fighter)
Remember the days of 8bit computing where we only had limited resources to play with, when games were 
very simple and the graphics terrible❗️ This a take on an 8bit game, with simple game play and 
terrible graphics 😅 

This game uses a simple flutter code serves as basic "game engine", the engine (core) of the game 
has been developed based on the published repository on https://github.com/amugofjava/dash_run

#### Running the game
- Clone the repo with: git clone https://github.com/hanisimo/covid_fighters.git
- Change to the "covid_fighters" directory and then execute: flutter run

#### Playing the game
Swipe left and right to move your team member. Tap to throw a antivirus. If an on of the COVID-19 
virus manages to reach the ground or peck the Fighter, the game ends.

#### Third party libraries
The developer of the original repository (at https://github.com/amugofjava/dash_run) has wanted to 
see what he could build within the 5Kb limit and just the Flutter SDK. As such, this app does not 
use any plugins or additional packages.
